    "## Github Copilot  Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will go over usage of github Copilot  for Open Source projects which\n",
    "are part of a eco-system of other projects within a standards body. \n",
    "\n",
    "An initial aim is to find out it's usefulness for MaterialX \n",
    "code development. The hope is that since it is using [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex) \n",
    "that it can leverage existing open source github repositories for MaterialX as well as\n",
    "related ASWF projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We concentrate on source code since that appears to be the main focus of Copilot .\n",
    "When asked non programming questions Copilot  will reply: `Sorry, but I can only assist with programming related questions.` Strangely the prompt `What is the latest version of MaterialX`` returns this answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a complimentary tool, the public beta of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/using-github-copilot-chat\" target=\"_blank\">Copilot Chat</a> was also installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> See [Sectup section](#setup) at the end test setup for Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gating Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at the following factors\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validity** and Correctness: Can code and documentation be generated that is correct and from a validated source?\n",
    "- **Accountability**: If code is generated can it be traced back to the original source? \n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Can it save time and effort in development?\n",
    "- **Standards**: Does it follow the standards of the project, standard body?\n",
    "- **Security**: Does it introduce security risks?\n",
    "- **Relevance**: Does it provide suggestions that are up-to-date and relevant to the project?\n",
    "- **Repeatability**: Can it be used to repeat the same task over and over again with consistent results?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this notebook was written with Copilot  enabled to test it's usefulness in assisting with writing documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general suggestion is to selectively enable Copilot  as it can branch off and suggest text and code which can have no relevance to the task / topic at hand. This is due to lack of context provided in the instruction for Copilot. This includes\n",
    "currently logged issues where only the visible editor text is scanned for context.\n"

    "\n",

    "any custom training data Copilot will:\n",
    "- Generate code or documentation\n",
    "- Complete code or documentation for APIs which do exist or uses code from an unrelated API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not just returning the incorrect version of a call but instead creating non-existent code calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "This not only extends to MaterialX specific code, but also to code from other projects and even\n",
    "established APIs such as Python and Javascript. It sometimes will generate calls for one API\n",
    "based on existing calls for another API which greatly lowers the trust factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a trivial example using comments as hints for code generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`getDefinitions()` does not exist in the API but is suggested by Copilot. The same is true when asking to create\n",

For this aspect it is not worth using Co-Pilot for such as task. Naming convention also seems not possible to perform. Other small consistency items such as adding in a default copyright appears to also not be possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no way to add in requirements for version of compiler, platform, and other build dependencies including what test harness is being used. As such it is possible to have code which is compliant being suggested which will not compile or run. \n",
