    "```\n",
    "   gen<target>\n",

    "\n",
    "For example the target for the OSL shading language is `genosl`, with the submodule's target string being `GenOsl`.\n",
    "The variants for GLSL include: `genglsl` and `genessl`, with single submodule with target string `GenGlsl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sub-module is roughly equivalent to a library (dynamic or static) for the C++ distribution which has the name:\n",
    "```\n",
    "   MaterialXGen<target>\n",
    "```\n",
    "That is with the `Py` prefix\n",
    "\n",
    "The submodule `PyMaterialxShader` contains the base support for all code generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below the submodule is imported in addition to  all generators which are part of the core distribution of MaterialX."
