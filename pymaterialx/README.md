# Python MaterialX Workspace

This folder can be used as a workspace for using MaterialX via Python. There are various example `(.ipynb)` files which correspond to
tutorials (Jupyter notebooks) on the learning site. The corresponding html and python files are generated from those notebooks.
MaterialX and other support files are included as well.

The files are targeted for usage with Visual Studio code with appropriate plug-ins installed to run in a Python virtual environment but other
editors can be used as desired. These can be used as is or pubiished to something like a github codespace or Google Colab. Currently they
are not published as yet due to lack of a PyPi package for MaterialX (note that at time of writing this is in the works).
