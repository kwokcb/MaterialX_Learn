## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

If you find something that’s broken or have ideas for improvement, here’s what to do:

1. **Check for Existing Issues:** Take a look to see if someone’s already reported the issue.
2. **Create a New Issue:** If it’s not there yet, create a new one. Be sure to include:
   - A clear title.
   - Details about the problem or suggestion.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (if needed).
   - Screenshots, code snippets, or error messages if they’ll help.

### 2. Contributing

We’d love your help with code, tools, interactive learning features, or better docs!
