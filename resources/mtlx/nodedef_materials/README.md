## MaterialX Definitions As Materials

This folder contains one MaterialX file per definition as of the current MaterialX version. 
The files are autogenerated by examining every definition and attaches conversion nodes to each output on a definition.
These conversion nodes are new as of **1.38.7**.

These files were used to generate the sample swatches used for the definition reference library used on the site
by generating `OSL` shaders and then rendering with `testrender`.
