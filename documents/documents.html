                  Documents are top level containers of all 'elements' supported by MaterialX.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is useful to split up the contents of documents based on these semantic categories:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Shaders and Materials</b>: This includes all nodes, graphs, definitions, implementations and
                    shader
                    translation</li>
                  <li><b>Geometry Bindings</b>: This includes looks, material assignments, and application bindings.
                    This section will not cover this topic and any associated document level properties such as
                    geometry identifier tokens.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Usage of geometry bindings can be considered to be " optional" especially as it can overlap with other
                systems such as USD which perform this functionality. Splitting into separate documents is required as
                there no other organization or partition mechanism save for `backdrop` elements. These however only
                support node groupings, and do not affect functionality. </p>
                <p>
                  The corresponding API class is <a href="https://materialx.org/docs/api/class_document.html"
                    target="_blank">Document</a>.
                  Here you will find a listing of interfaces roughly broken down by the type of element.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some important properties that are maintained at the document level include:
                <ol>
                  <li>

                        It is important to note that the "build" version is <em>not</em> stored in a document,
                        but releases do include a build version that can be queried from this interface.
                        For example a document may have version "1.38", but the build version could be '1.38.2".
                        See the section on "Compatibility and Upgrade" to see how this affects the logic there.

                      It is a handy way to set the root directory for all image file names,
                      without having to modify each individual reference. Note that
                      'fileprefix' will not be used to prefix file names which have absolute paths and that `fileprefix`
                      can also be defined on a node graph -- which will prepend it's token before the document's token.

                        target="_blank">StringResolver</a>.
                      Within the API the word <b>resolved</b> is used to indicate interface variants which return the
                      value after applying a resolver. For example <a

                        getResolvedValueString()</a> would return a filename

                  <li>The term <b>" resolve"</b> means to take
                  some data and find the form which can natively be consumed by some deployment / integration.
                  This will mostly apply to identifiers and URI paths.

                    into their corresponding nodes and node graphs, but also means to transfer
                    document attributes such as `fileprefx`, `colorspace` and `namespace` to each element
                    inside a document.

                  Even though any number of documents may be kept in files for interoperability,
                  it is recommended to work on a single " working" document at runtime, though there is no formal
                    designation for this. Document creation interfaces work under the premise that: <ul>
                    <li>content is cumulative (appended) to a given document</li>
                    <li>some validity checks are performed at read time</li>
                    <li>duplicate elements cannot be created and thus not added. Note that this can result in
                      an incomplete reading of data.</li>
                    <li>nodes with categories which are not defined are invalid. There is now way to preserve nodes
                      which
                      are
                      an unknown category, making it possible that reading or write loses data. As a guiding rule
                      node definitions should be loaded into a document before any instances of those definitions.

                            A document is allowed to become "invalid" (not follow the specification). The 'validate()'

                          exclusion of these elements at write time. An example can be to exclude
                          library definitions from node instances as shown below:<br>

                          At runtime, these tags can be used for instance to
                          enforce additional user rules such as being non-editable, or non-deletable.

                            For node definitions, there is currently no formal construct for a "collection" (set) of
                            documents
                            to be used as a "library" / "module" / "package" etc and is thus up to the user
                            to overlay semantics to partition content.

                            come with the MaterialX distribution. Note that the folder names can be used
                            to semantically separate a 'bxdf', and 'pbrlib', and 'stdlib' library, but
                            there is no information within a document or set of documents which indicate it
                            is or belongs to a "library".

                          In this case the 'import' API, will return a list of all files read under a given
                          folder. These can be used to keep track of what documents have been read. As
                          all the imported elements are tagged with the 'sourcuri' for the file it
                          is read from, this can be used to filter out 'library' content from non-library
                          content.

                <p>
                  By intent, the MaterialX format is designed for interoperability using a standard set (library) of
                  definitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some points of interest for interop follow:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p><b>Independence of interfaces from implementations</b> is intentional. Any definitions which are
                      based on
                      standard library definitions can be supported by all core backend shader implementations thus
                      providing for <b>implementation standardization</b>. Source code implementations for standard
                      library definitions
                      are written to conform with one another. e.g the GLS, OSL, MDL and MSL implementations are meant to be
                      logically identical.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>Dependent resources are not embedded into the file format
                    itself but only referenced. For example, geometry and images
                    is not encoded into the MaterialX format, though it is an interesting avenue
                    which has been followed by other formats.
                    <ul>

                      <li>One " downside" is that additional "side-car" files which define intrinsically part of
                            an "asset" need to be kept track of somewhere else. </li>
                            <li>An "upside" is no dependence on additional resource
                              handling utilities is required as part of the core distribution.
                            </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                              Naturally transferring to a system which embeds dependent data requires additional logic ,
                              and
                              conversely transforming from such a system requires "unpacking" logic.
                              For example `glTF` embeds images and requiring specific packing and unpacking (e.g. is
                              "occlusion, roughness, metalic" packing into single images). Some of these are not as
                              bespoke, so
                              could be potentially encoded as reusable node graphs.

                              <p>It is useful to keep image references using relative URI paths and use `fileprefix`
                                specifiers
                                and only "resolve" to absolute paths during deployment (e.g. when
                                sending to a renderer or code generation).). Utilities to resolve are categorized
                                as part of the "resolving" process. This would also include `UDIM` file name resolution.
                              </p>

                              <p>It is also useful to keep `colorspace` and `unit`s unresolved. For both,
                                resolution logic is dependent on the deployment target. e.g. the working colorspace for
                                a render,
                                or the unit applied to geometry within an application.</p>

                                shader code at deployment time. For example a "plastic" material could be a definition
                                which is
                                converted to standard library nodes at some later time. However for interop purposes,
                                instances of
                                the plastic material are passed around.

                                A node definition "flattening" can be achieved using the <a

                                An integration may deem that it is too "costly" to keep abstract definitions and instead
                                keep only standard library nodes, or just source code. The first, still allows for
                                implementation
                                independence and maintains interoperability, but the latter does not.
                                For example `Three.js` keeps static code snippets for
                                definitions. This static source code can easily be out of sync and can lose important
                                properties
                                like versioning.

                <p>
                  MaterialX has been designed to be file format backwards compatible. Thus
                  any older document can always be assumed to be compatible with the current
                  version of MateriaX.

                  There is a built in " upgrade" mechanism which is available as a document level utility (<a
                              href="https://materialx.org/docs/api/class_document.html" target="_blank">
                              `upgradeVersion()`</a>)
                              to upgrade a documents contents current runtime version.
                              Note that issues can ensue by running different run-times with different versions as
                              you may end up with incompatible documents. A "single version" model is recommended.
                              <br><br>
                              <img class="p-2 bg-light" src="./images/upgrade_document.svg" />

                              <p>
                                An upgrade will automatically be performed as part of document reading.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Note that for and between patch releases the version number of saved documents
                                does not change and thus upgrade will not occur.
                                For example, a patch release of "1.38.6" will not perform any upgrade for a document
                                of version "1.38" as only the major (1) and minor (38) versions are compared.

                                Automatic upgrading can be overridden

                                A small caveat is that if something has been deprecated and removed from a release the
                                document
                                may not read in properly.
                                For convenience, a Material release includes a Python utility script

                              <p>There is no mechanism to "downgrade" a document to an earlier version.
                                Examples of changes to be watchful for include existing node definition changes,
                                and addition of new definitions. It is recommended to <b>not</b>
                                replace older versions with a newer version if not required.

                              <p>Note that if there are resource or geometric binding dependencies
                                it may be required to version them as well. An example of this is "standard_surface"
                                which changed the default values of it's `base` and `base_color` attributes by swapping
                                them
                                (0.8, and 1.0 in the older version and 1.0 and 0.8 in the newer). Thus if there was a
                                previous texture
                                bound to `base` which assumed
                                a modulation by a `base_color` of 1.0, then it's contents would need to be modified
                                taking into
                                account
                                that the current `base_color` is now 0.8.

                                Basically, the upgrade mechanism does not know and thus cannot take into consideration
                                external
                                content and non-standard library definitions changes. This is the responsibility of the
                                integration.

                                Anything that is stored which is not part of a MaterialX document is also not taken into
                                consideration
                                when upgrading. This includes derived / generated content such as shader code. For
                                instance if `OSL`
                                code is
                                generated for a given version, if that code implementation changes in a future version
                                the originally
                                generated code may not be compatible with the newly generated code.
                                Thus as with interoperability, it is recommended to keep data in it's "original"
                                MaterialX form
                                as much as possible.
