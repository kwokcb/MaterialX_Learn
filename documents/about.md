#### About

The aim of this site is target as wide an audience as possible, with the primary goals to aid in learning, developing and integrating MaterialX with respect to user workflows.

Detailed specification information can be found at the [MaterialX site](https://materialx.org/) which includes additional documents and presentations from the authors. The aim is not to reproduce but to distill and enhance with complementary content.

In the "spirit" of MaterialX, the site design tries to match the related content. Where applicable, all drawings and renderings (including the site logo) are generated using MaterialX.

#### Development

<a href="https://github.com/kwokcb/MaterialX_Learn" target="_blank"><img src="./images/GitHub_Logo.png" width="50"></a> The hope is that this site will grow organically over
time based on user feedback.

Naturally any contributions are greatly appreciated, especially in terms of "learning" tutorials, and example
user workflows. More will be added to the GitHub repo as things progress. 

Currently all content is structured to be as reusable as
possible outside of this site, even if not fully discussed yet.

*To contribute to the MaterialX open source effort any applicable work done here will be integrated back into the <a href="https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX" target="_blank">core repository</a>*
