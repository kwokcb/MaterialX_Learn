## Documents

This folder contains both manually created and generated files used on the public site.
The `definitions` pages are fully generated based on the current MaterialX definition library using utitities written
in Python. This includes an enhanced version of `mxdoc` (found with the core MaterialX distribution), shader generation and
swatch rendering, and diagram diagram generation. The glossary is also fully generated by parsing types, color management and units
definitions.
