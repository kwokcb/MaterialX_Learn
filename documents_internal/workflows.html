          <h2>1. MaterialX and Usd</h2>

          <img src="images/usd_materialx_interop.png" width="40%">
          <p>The <a href="../pymaterialx/mtlx_definitions_libraries_notebook.html">Usd / MaterialX notebook</a>
            examines the
            interoperability of material / shader graphs between <code>Usd</code> and <code>MaterialX</code>.</p>
          <p>Observations are summarized below.</p>

          <h3>Hierarchy</h3>
          <p>Currently Usd can support arbitrary nesting of graphs. The MaterialX specification also denotes this
            support but this has not been implemented at the time of writing.</p>
          <p>Usd will "flatten" nested graphs to a single level, but this
            functionally does not seem to be exposed via a public API.</p>
          <p>For example the following graphs nodegraph "childNG" has to be placed under the nodegraph "parentNG"
            to be supported in MaterialX.
            <img src="images/nested_nodegraphs.png" width="70%">
          </p>
          <p>It is possible to "flatten" graphs within MaterialX, but no such
            utility / API is provided by default.</p>
          <p>In Usd, for encapsulation, shader graphs are children of a Usd material with reuse via referencing. In
            MaterialX materials are not parents of the graphs they reference. No child hierarchy / grouping
            is enforced. (For more detailed information see the <a href="#materials">Materials</a> section) </p>
          <p><em>One proposal would be to
              <a href="https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX/issues/1272">support MaterialX node graph
                hierarchies</a></em>. Related to this is how a "top" or document level
            graphs (which is not contained in a MaterialX nodegraph) behave.
            Basically MaterialX documents are "graph elements" as
            are MaterialX nodegraphs but are inconsistent from nodegraphs in that output ports are treated as AOVs and
            input ports are not allowed.</p>

          <h3>Paths and Connections</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Usd specifies explicit output ports on nodes and graphs. MaterialX only does this for nodegraphs,
              requiring complex logic
              to discover and extract node output information.</li>
            <li>There is no uniform nor formal connection "API" in MaterialX as with Usd. This could be added to
              MaterialX to mask out the
              complexities due to the next point:</li>
            <li>There is no uniform syntax for specifying connections between
              ports and nodes in a MaterialX graph. Variants exists for connections between:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>requirement to extract various meta-data attributes to compose a path.</li>
              <li>input and output ports for nodes versus nodegraphs </li>
              <li>nodegraph (interface) inputs / outputs vs node inputs and outputs. </li>
              <li>
                Implicit channel extraction via additional meta-data attributes which does not exist in Usd.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              <p>MaterialX has no concept of absolute vs relative path notation to specify port paths. (This differs
                from geometric dag paths used for material assignment)</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>This contrasts with Usd which simply uses absolute paths syntax for all connections (e.g. '/a/b/c') which
            are specified on
            input ports. The path references output ports which always exist.</p>
          <p>A path API in Usd has no correspondence in MaterialX. A MaterialX <code>FilePath</code> can be used in
            lieu of this, or
            path modification can be done via string changes.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Note that MaterialX uses relative paths to form connections and does not allow for parent path syntax
              (such as "../"). This has the advantage of assuring that no connections are ever formed between ports
              which do not have the same parent. This rule appears for Usd as well, but it could be possible with
              absolute path usage to connect to arbitrary ports within the hierarchy.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Note that there is a connection <code>edge</code> construct but this is only available within upstream
            traversal within an iterator.</p>
          <p>Downstream traversal is available in MaterialX relies on a caching system which is always dirtied on
            arbitrary attribute changes and not just connection changes.</p>

          <h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
          <p>Usd represents a material as a node graph (container). This allows for arbitrary inputs and outputs to
            exist, with connections being made to child ports within the material.</p>
          <p>MaterialX used to have a similar concept for materials but only
            as a material "collection". As of version 1.38.6, material nodes were introduced
            (<code>surfacematerial</code> and <code>volumematerial</code>)
            which more closely matches existing DCC concepts such as "shading engines" in Maya.</p>
          <p>If bidirectional interop between Usd and MaterialX is performed, the question arises as to how handle the
            mapping.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following diagram shows the class hierarchy for Usd and MaterialX. It is mostly the discrepancy between
            have one as a graph and one as a pair of atomic nodes which allows for different approaches to mapping.
            <img src="images/usd_material_vs_mtlx_material.png" width="80%">
          </p>
          <p>Applications like Maya and Houdini have "graph containers"
            which more closely match a nodegraph.
          <ul>
            <li>If the Usd material graph is mapped to a MaterialX material then arbitrary inputs and outputs have no
              place to map to
              and the interop is lossy.
            <li>MaterialX material nodes cannot be children of a translated Usd material, but perhaps could be created
              as additional materials
              referencing the same shader graph. This is a bit of a strange mapping and makes it difficult to perform
              the reverse mapping.
            <li>If the Usd material graph is mapped to a MaterialX nodegraph then it is no longer distinguishable as a
              "material".
          </ul>
          </p>
          Additionally, note that when if the chosen mapping is from a Usd material graph to a MaterialX material node,
          that
          the shader ports are <strong>output</strong> ports while for MaterialX they are <strong>input</strong>
          ports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus in Usd, these are output-to-output connections (as would occur in a MaterialX node-to-nodegraph)
            instead of input-to-output connections occurs with MaterialX node-to-node connections. The notebook shows
            the
            added logic complexity.</p>

          <h3>Ports</h3>
          <p>For the most parts Usd ports correspond 1:1 with MaterialX ports. At the time of writing MaterialX tokens
            do not correspond to Usd
            (tokens).</p>
          <p>Some differences to note:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>There is a superset of possible types in Usd vs MaterialX. This includes types which indicate
              precision (e.g. half-float vs float), signed and unsigned types, and various array types.
              Usage of Usd with MaterialX definitions should avoid any type mapping issues for interop.
            </li>
            <li>Usd uses <code>asset</code> references vs MaterialX which has only file name references for image
              resources. At
              the current time binary resource references are not supported in MaterialX.</li>
            <li>Usd uses <code>token</code> to represent shader ports on materials.
              This requires additional parsing of the port name to discover if the port maps to a surface,
              displacement, or volume shader type in MaterialX. </li>
            <li>There is some minor string syntax difference for representing tuples in Usd versus MaterialX which
              requires
              some extra mapping logic.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Supported Nodes</h3>
          <p>Usd supports nodes which are not defined in MaterialX.
            As such there is no way to map these to MaterialX unless "dummy" nodes are added. </p>
          <p>If MaterialX and non-MaterialX graphs are under the same parent, if they do not reference by each other,
            it seems possible to extract MaterialX subgraphs out and merge them back in. (Note that this was not
            attempted in the notebook example)</p>

          <h3>Material Assignment</h3>
          <p>Though MaterialX can support material assignments via it's <code>look</code> API, this was not examined
            as the intent is to have Usd perform this role with the <code>look</code> interfaces being optional going
            forward with the 1.39 release.</p>

          <h3>Usd-based versus Material-based Integrations</h3>
          <p>As part of the "Libraries / Definitions" notebook export was examined for Maya and Houdini. The both work
            within the
            context of integration with Usd.</p>
          <p>Of note is that for Maya graphs MaterialX material nodes are currently disallowed but sub-graphs are
            allowed, while Houdini material nodes are allowed but sub-graphs are both not exportable.<br>
            <img src="images/houdini_disallowed_nodes.png" width="60%">
          </p>
          <p>This could be cause some confusion as to how these map to MaterialX. (At time of
            writing Maya does not support MaterialX export so to be determined how each integration progresses).
            Additionally it will be interesting to see the approach taken by Blender for MaterialX export.</p>
          <p>Currently <b>only the MaterialX Graph Editor</b> works without the notion of mapping to a Usd "container"
            (material graph). That said if MaterialX import is supported it is possible some
            graph configurations are not supported or required some type of
            transformation such as "flattening" or remapping.</p>
          <img src="images/graph_editor_supported.png" width="60%">
          <p>These are still "early days" and will be interesting to see how
            this all works out.</p>

          <h2>2. MaterialX and glTF</h2>
          <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kwokcb/glTF_MaterialX/main/docs/bidirectional_workflow.png"
              width="80%"></p>
          <p>Bi-directional conversion between MaterialX and glTF is available via the library and utilities found in
            <a href="https://github.com/kwokcb/glTF_MaterialX" target="_blank">this repo.</a>
          </p>
          <p>As MaterialX supports the glTF PBR surface shading model directly
            as of version 1.38.6, the mapping from a glTF surface shader
            to MaterialX is fairly straight forward. Supplementary nodes which match the glTF image mapping logic are
            provided as
            part of the MaterialX standard library and are used during translation.</p>
          <p>The reverse process which is the more natural one requires "distilling" a MaterialX shading graph down to
            a glTF one.</p>
          <p>If users use only the MaterialX nodes supported which correspond to glTF then this mapping is more
            straight-forward.
            If not then a "baking" step is required to convert all upstream connected graphs into a single image, and
            if a non-glTF shading model is used then "shader translation" is required.
          <p>
            Below is an example of the "Brick" example shader which uses the "Autodesk standard surface" which is mapped
            to
            a glTF PBR surface material and the result of baking a "ORM" map (along with other maps).
            <br>
            <img src="images/Brick_ORM_baking.png" width="40%">
          </p>
          </p>
          <p>Fortunately, translation and baking are provided as part of the code API. What is not currently handled
            however is merging of multiple images into single images such as for <code>ORM</code> images used by glTF
            shaders. This would be a useful utility, and could be done as a MaterialX shader graph.</p>

          <h2>3. MaterialX Libraries</h2>
          <p>The creation of custom definitions is being done by a few integrations such as for Maya, Houdini, and
            appears to be the direction for Blender.</p>
          <p>Agreement on semantics and syntax is under discussion. The
            <code>Libraries and Definitions</code> notebook contains some current workflow investigations.
