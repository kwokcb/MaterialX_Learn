                                a user can enhance documentation and learning workflows for MaterialX by adding tools on
                                top of MaterialX itself.
                                The following color coding is used in the diagrams provided:
                            <ul>

                                The following diagram outlines the setup for generating documentation from MaterialX.
                                The main utilities were written using the Python wrappers for MaterialX:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Diagram generation ('mxgraphio')</b>: This can produce Mermaid 
                                    diagrams based on MaterialX input. The
                                    standard library graphs are generated this way, but any MaterialX graph can be used
                                    as input.
                                </li>
                                <p></p>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Sampling graphs for rendering ('genMaterialsFromDefs')</b>: All definitions in
                                    the MaterialX library had instance
                                    graphs created as separate MaterialX files. These files are rendered using
                                    the custom GLSL Python renderer (`mxrenderer`) provided on this site via the 
                                    `renderDocuments` Python utility command.
                                    <br>
                                    Note that any renderer that can consume MaterialX can be used.
                                </li>
                                <p></p>
                                <li><b>Documentation and indexing generation ('mxdoclib')</b>: This extracted al data
                                    from the MaterialX definition libraries to generate all library pages. images
                                    were converted to <i>webp</i> for non-rendered images using Google

                                    Both Markdown and HTML output is supported.

                                    set of definition libraries and generates Markdown or HTML output. The HTML
                                    output is available under the <em>Reference->Library Revisions</em> menu.

                                    <b>Interactive Viewing</b>: Currently both direct MaterialX as well as 
                                    glTF versions of MaterialX shaders is under investigation. As the goal is to
                                    have an interactive viewer the native viewing will be the target. Currently
                                    only glTF PBR is available for viewing with a few input parameters available
                                    for editing.

                            </ul>
                            These utilities are accessible from the "Utilities" section of this site and added to MaterialX
                            core distribution.

                                A number of Javascript utilities were written to handle:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Graph Rendering</b>:
                                    Additional Javascript logic is added as part of the generation process.
                                    Interactive Mermaid graph (svg) generation from text was added as the performance
                                    cost to generate all hundreds of graphs can slow down page load speed.
                                    It was additionally necessary to workaround a Bootstrap / Mermaid issue where
                                    graphs under hidden elements don't render properly -- in which case all
                                    tab sections on documentation pages require dynamic generation.
                                    The same logic is
                                    used for the 'Graph Visualizer' utility.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Node Definition Creation</b>: Simple utilities for creating definitions from nodegraphs is used for
                                    the corresponding utility pages.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Graph Copying / Saving</b>: Graph text copying utilities were added to allow
                                    extraction
                                    of the mermaid text and for conversion from Mermaid text to SVG.

                                The core module is available separately from code generation online starting with version 1.38.9.
