<!-- Color management definitions description -->
<h5>Node Definitions</h5>
<p>As of <b>1.38.8</b> color space transforms have node definitions and can thus be
instantiated as nodes in a shader graph. Each definition name is of the form:
being:
<pre>
    &lt;source_space_name&gt;_to_&lt;definition_space_name&gt;
</pre>
such that source and destination color space names conform those found in the
<a href="https://github.com/colour-science/OpenColorIO-Configs/blob/master/aces_1.2/config.ocio"
    target="_blank">AcesCg 1.2 OCIO configuration</a>.
</p>
<p>
    All definitions use the node group `colortransform` and can be found under that group
    in the library reference:

    An example is the <a href="acescg_to_lin_rec709.html">AcesCg to LinRec709 transform</a>
</p>    
<p>
    Note that any transforms which are currently specified as only
    implementations will need to provide a node definition in addition to the implementation or they will not be
    recognized as being a valid source color space. This includes usage within shader code generation.  
</p>

<h5>Usage on Inputs</h5>
<p>A color space transform can be used by specifying the source space 'colorspace' attribute on the any 3 and 4 channel color inputs.
    It is invalid to set this on any other element type.
</p>
<p>The <a href="artistic_ior.html" target="_blank">artistic_ior</a> definition shows an example of
    specifying an 'edge_color' input 'colorspace' as <em>'lin_rec709'</em>.

    <hr> 
    In the same example the 'ior' input has a 'colorspace' value of <em>'none'</em>. 'none' has a special
    meaning which indicates that the input should not be interpreted as a color
    which can be transformed (there is no color swatch to indicate this).

</p>
<p>For evaluation, the 'colorspace' attribute value can be parsed to determine the input colorspace. 
    For code generation, either the
    colorspace name is passed on to the generated shader code, or it is replaced with color transformation code 
    which is added into the generated shader code. A code generation option is provided for user control.
