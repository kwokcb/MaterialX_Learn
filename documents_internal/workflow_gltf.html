              presentation</a>.</p>
          <p>The diagram below is taken from that presentation to show the workflow. glTF content can be split up and
            the material descriptions converted to MaterialX. Conversely MaterialX can be converted to glTF materials
            which can then be bound to geometry.</p>

          <p>The current workflow is a one-way conversion from glTF to MaterialX but is highly restrictive in that it
            only supports a subset of MaterialX nodes.</p>
          <p>There is currently an initiative to define a MaterialX extension for glTF which would allow for a more
            general conversion by supporting embedding MaterialX pattern graphs inside of glTF.</p>
          <p>This includes a proposal to support serialization of MaterialX to <code>JSON</code> format.</p>
          <p>The <a href="../pymaterialx/mtlx_json_notebook.html" target="_blank">JSON notebook</a> presents one way to
            extract out MaterialX pattern graphs and serialize to <code>JSON</code>. This ties in with the general <a
              href="https://https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX/issues/1500">MaterialX JSON
              Serialization Proposal</a> which is currently under discussion.</p>

          <h3 id="%22target%22-materialx-representation">&quot;Target&quot; MaterialX Representation</h3>
          <p>There are two main targets for interop:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Shading Models:</p>
              <p>MaterialX supports the glTF PBR surface shading model directly as of version 1.38.6, allowing for
                mostly a 1:1 mapping between glTF and MaterialX.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Pattern Graphs:</p>
              <p>Supplementary nodes which match the glTF image<br>
                mapping logic are provided as part of the MaterialX standard library.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>As MaterialX can represent an arbitrary shader graph it is not possible to map this completely to glTF
            which supports a fixed set of shaders and upstream pattern nodes (texture lookups)</p>
          <p>Thus there is a specific MaterialX node graph configuration which is the recommended &quot;target&quot; for
            distillation / export as well as remixing / import. These node graphs can be created in various editors
            including <code>Maya</code>, <code>Houdini</code>, etc and <code>USD HDStorm</code> integrations in general
            as long as the appropriate MaterialX library version is used.</p>

            <br><sub>Figure: Layout of &quot;target&quot; node graphs. Note that 0 or more upstream pattern graphs are
              supported for inputs to the root PBR shader</sub>
          </p>
          <p>The definitions for these nodes can be found as part of the <a
              href="https://github.com/kwokcb/MaterialX/blob/main/libraries/bxdf/gltf_pbr.mtlx">core MaterialX library
              definitions</a></p>
          <h3 id="colorspaces-and-real-world-units">Colorspaces and Real World Units</h3>
          <p>For a primer on glTF, USD and MaterialX differences Eric Haines presentation <a
              href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/erich/gltf_usd/glTF_and_USD.pdf">here</a> is a useful reference.
          </p>
          <p>Extrapolating from this, as part of distillation / export it is possible to to a certain extent to
            pre-convert units and colorspaces to match the glTF fixed colorspace and unit conventions.</p>
          <p>If in the future real world units are supported in glTF then the appropriate semantic unit tagging can be
            added to<br>
            the existing inputs are additional attributes. Input values are not considered to be mappable and hence if a
            unit semantic is provided import / export can handle this via either a 3rd-party or built in scale unit
            conversion utility.</p>
          <p>Colorspace conversion is currently handled via the texture &quot;baking&quot; utilities available in
            MaterialX. Other 3rd-party utilities could be used as well.</p>

          <p>For conversion from glTF to MaterialX, the following nodes can be used to provide a 1:1 mapping:</p>
          <h4 id="gltfimage"><code>&lt;gltf_image&gt;</code></h4>
          <p>This node provides an interface which matches how image lookup are performed within glTF 2.0 based on this

            <p>
            <p>The following differences need to be accounted for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The transform pivot is 0,0 for MaterialX but 0,1 for glTF.
                <ul>
                  <li>Offset is thus negated in V</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Rotation is specified as radians versus angles and is reverse direction. (negation required)</li>
              <li>Scale is inverted between MaterialX and glTF</li>
              <li>The default transformation order is TRS for glTF and not SRT. This option is set correctly on this
                node.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is supported for all variants of this node: vector3, float, color3, and color4. No vector2 variant
              is required at this time.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>One texture coordinate set referenced by set name, with the default set being &quot;UV0&quot; which is
                equal to set 0.
                <ul>
                  <li>Names are used to support <strong>OpenUSD</strong> workflows where al sets are named.</li>
                  <li>A <code>&lt;texcoord&gt;</code> node which a different index can be connected to provide index
                    based workflows as found for glTF.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>U and V address modes and filter type are accessible with the defaults for glTF and MaterialX
                matching.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The color4 output is split into color3 and alpha outputs which can be directly mapped to a

            <p>This encapsulates color/alpha management where an color4 image lookup can be modulated by a color4 factor
              as well as geometric color4. That is final color is (base on this <a

            <p>The input image can have a &quot;colorspace&quot; semantic specified. By default for import/export this
              should be <code>srgb_texture</code> but is not hard-coded as part of the definition. Color factor is set
              to be uniform and both it and geometry color are assumed to be specified in the rendering / target
              colorspace.</p>
            <p>As not all geometry have geometric colors , the default &quot;geometry color&quot; input is a uniform
              value = { 1,1,1,1 }<br>
              which can be mapped to a <code>&lt;geomcolor&gt;</code> node as required. That node allows for color set

            <p>This node encapsulates a file texture which is a normal map. It uses <code>&lt;gltf_vector3&gt;</code>
              and <code>&lt;normalmap&gt;</code> as it's main components to provide base level glTF support which always
              outputs a normal map. normalmap space is not an exposed interface and is always set to tangent space, with

          <h3 id="distillation--export--materialx-to-gltf">Distillation / Export : MaterialX to glTF</h3>
          <p>The reverse process which is the more natural one requires<br>
            <code>distilling</code> a MaterialX shading graph down to a glTF one.
          </p>
          <p>Below is a diagram of the distillation process taken from the <a
              href="https://materialx.org/assets/ASWF_OSD2022_MaterialX_OSL_Final.pdf">ASWF 2022 Open Source days
              presentation</a>.<br>
            <img src="images/osd2022_gltf_distill.png" width="100%">
          </p>
          <p>If users use only the MaterialX nodes supported which correspond to glTF then this mapping is more
            straight-forward. If not then a <code>baking</code> step is required to convert all upstream connected
            graphs into a single<br>
            image, and if a non-glTF shading model is used then <code>shader translation</code> is required.</p>
          <p>Below is an example of the <code>Brick</code> example shader which uses the
            <code>Autodesk standard surface</code> which is mapped to a glTF PBR surface material and the result of
            baking a <code>ORM</code> map (along with other maps).<br>
            <img src="images/Brick_ORM_baking.png" width="100%">
          </p>
          <p>Fortunately, translation and baking are provided as part of the code API. What is not currently handled
            however is merging of multiple images into single images such as for <code>ORM</code> images used by glTF
            shaders. This would be a useful utility, and could be done as a MaterialX shader graph.</p>
