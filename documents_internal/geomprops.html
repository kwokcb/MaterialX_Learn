<!-- Geometry Properties -->
<p>
    Built-in geometry identifiers ('geomdefprop') are provided as part of the standard library. Each has a unique name,
    a type, and the space that the input geometry resides in. For convenience the geometry type and
    space are reflected in the name. For example: "Pobject" is position in object space. Only node definitions may
    specify these identifiers in the <em>'defaultgeomprop'</em> attribute for an
    'input'.

<p>The corresponding API class is
    <a href="https://materialx.org/docs/api/class_geom_prop_def.html" target="_blank">GeomPropDef</a>
</p>
<p>The <a href="bump.html" target="_blank">bump definition</a> contains an example of specifying it's
    'normal' input as defaulting to routing world space normals as input by default.
</p>
<p>Note that except for the 'Description', the column headings for this section are the attribute names 
    for a 'geomdefprop'.</p>
