<!-- Type definitions -->
<p>
    The following table lists all core supported types for node inputs, outputs and tokens types.
</p>
<p>
    These are defined as 'typedef' elements in the standard library. The name of the 'typedef' is used
    to specify the `type' of an input, output or token.
    Note that except for the 'Description', the column headings for this section are the attribute names 
    on a 'typedef'.
    </p>
<p>
    Though new types can theoretically be defined this is not recommended as these new types is not
    automatically recognized. For instance, both file I/O and shader generation will not recognize these types.
</p>
<p>
    The associated API for a 'typedef' is <a href="https://materialx.org/docs/api/class_type_def.html" target="_blank">TypeDef</a>
    and can be accessed via the <a href="https://materialx.org/docs/api/class_document.html" target="_blank">'getTypeDef()'</a>
    document API.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the type 'geomname' is not used as a type for inputs, outputs or tokens and 'none'
    was used for background nodes but has been deprecated as of version 1.38.
